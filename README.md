# SmartCar
A project for ELE417 Embedded System Design class for Hacettepe University


Worked with STM32F303RE board. It is done in STM32CubeIDE, with the uploaded files the project should be remade.

This part controls the motors with given controls from the other STM32F303RE board by UART communication.

Here is the youtube video that describes the project furtherly: https://youtu.be/byJkJK0ChQk?si=f65qXt_jLrN1bLpF
